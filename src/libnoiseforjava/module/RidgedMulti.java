   /// Noise module that outputs 3-dimensional ridged-multifractal noise.
   ///
   /// This noise module, heavily based on the Perlin-noise module, generates
   /// ridged-multifractal noise.  Ridged-multifractal noise is generated in
   /// much of the same way as Perlin noise, except the output of each octave
   /// is modified by an absolute-value function.  Modifying the octave
   /// values in this way produces ridge-like formations.
   ///
   /// Ridged-multifractal noise does not use a persistence value.  This is
   /// because the persistence values of the octaves are based on the values
   /// generated from from previous octaves, creating a feedback loop (or
   /// that's what it looks like after reading the code.)
   ///
   /// This noise module outputs ridged-multifractal-noise values that
   /// usually range from -1.0 to +1.0, but there are no guarantees that all
   /// output values will exist within that range.
   ///
   /// @note For ridged-multifractal noise generated with only one octave,
   /// the output value ranges from -1.0 to 0.0.
   ///
   /// Ridged-multifractal noise is often used to generate craggy mountainous
   /// terrain or marble-like textures.
   ///
   /// This noise module does not require any source modules.
   ///
   /// <b>Octaves</b>
   ///
   /// The number of octaves control the <i>amount of detail</i> of the
   /// ridged-multifractal noise.  Adding more octaves increases the detail
   /// of the ridged-multifractal noise, but with the drawback of increasing
   /// the calculation time.
   ///
   /// An application may specify the number of octaves that generate
   /// ridged-multifractal noise by calling the setOctaveCount() method.
   ///
   /// <b>Frequency</b>
   ///
   /// An application may specify the frequency of the first octave by
   /// calling the setFrequency() method.
   ///
   /// <b>Lacunarity</b>
   ///
   /// The lacunarity specifies the frequency multipler between successive
   /// octaves.
   ///
   /// The effect of modifying the lacunarity is subtle; you may need to play
   /// with the lacunarity value to determine the effects.  For best results,
   /// set the lacunarity to a number between 1.5 and 3.5.
