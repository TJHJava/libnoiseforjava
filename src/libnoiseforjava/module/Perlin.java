   /// Noise module that outputs 3-dimensional Perlin noise.
   ///
   /// Perlin noise is the sum of several coherent-noise functions of
   /// ever-increasing frequencies and ever-decreasing amplitudes.
   ///
   /// An important property of Perlin noise is that a small change in the
   /// input value will produce a small change in the output value, while a
   /// large change in the input value will produce a random change in the
   /// output value.
   ///
   /// This noise module outputs Perlin-noise values that usually range from
   /// -1.0 to +1.0, but there are no guarantees that all output values will
   /// exist within that range.
   ///
   /// For a better description of Perlin noise, see the links in the
   /// <i>References and Acknowledgments</i> section.
   ///
   /// This noise module does not require any source modules.
   ///
   /// <b>Octaves</b>
   ///
   /// The number of octaves control the <i>amount of detail</i> of the
   /// Perlin noise.  Adding more octaves increases the detail of the Perlin
   /// noise, but with the drawback of increasing the calculation time.
   ///
   /// An octave is one of the coherent-noise functions in a series of
   /// coherent-noise functions that are added together to form Perlin
   /// noise.
   ///
   /// An application may specify the frequency of the first octave by
   /// calling the setFrequency() method.
   ///
   /// An application may specify the number of octaves that generate Perlin
   /// noise by calling the setOctaveCount() method.
   ///
   /// These coherent-noise functions are called octaves because each octave
   /// has, by default, double the frequency of the previous octave.  Musical
   /// tones have this property as well; a musical C tone that is one octave
   /// higher than the previous C tone has double its frequency.
   ///
   /// <b>Frequency</b>
   ///
   /// An application may specify the frequency of the first octave by
   /// calling the setFrequency() method.
   ///
   /// <b>Persistence</b>
   ///
   /// The persistence value controls the <i>roughness</i> of the Perlin
   /// noise.  Larger values produce rougher noise.
   ///
   /// The persistence value determines how quickly the amplitudes diminish
   /// for successive octaves.  The amplitude of the first octave is 1.0.
   /// The amplitude of each subsequent octave is equal to the product of the
   /// previous octave's amplitude and the persistence value.  So a
   /// persistence value of 0.5 sets the amplitude of the first octave to
   /// 1.0; the second, 0.5; the third, 0.25; etc.
   ///
   /// An application may specify the persistence value by calling the
   /// setPersistence() method.
   ///
   /// <b>Lacunarity</b>
   ///
   /// The lacunarity specifies the frequency multipler between successive
   /// octaves.
   ///
   /// The effect of modifying the lacunarity is subtle; you may need to play
   /// with the lacunarity value to determine the effects.  For best results,
   /// set the lacunarity to a number between 1.5 and 3.5.
