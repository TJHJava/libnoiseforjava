   /// other seed point.  These cells mesh with one another, producing
   /// polygon-like formations.
   ///
   /// By default, this noise module randomly places a seed point within
   /// each unit cube.  By modifying the <i>frequency</i> of the seed points,
   /// an application can change the distance between seed points.  The
   /// higher the frequency, the closer together this noise module places
   /// the seed points, which reduces the size of the cells.  To specify the
   /// frequency of the cells, call the setFrequency() method.
   ///
   /// This noise module assigns each Voronoi cell with a random constant
   /// value from a coherent-noise function.  The <i>displacement value</i>
   /// controls the range of random values to assign to each cell.  The
   /// range of random values is +/- the displacement value.  Call the
   /// setDisplacement() method to specify the displacement value.

   /// method.
