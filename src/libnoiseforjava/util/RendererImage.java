   /// Renders an image from a noise map.
   ///
   /// This class renders an image given the contents of a noise-map object.
   ///
   /// An application can configure the output of the image in three ways:
   /// - Specify the color gradient.
   /// - Specify the light source parameters.
   /// - Specify the background image.
   ///
   /// <b>Specify the color gradient</b>
   ///
   /// This class uses a color gradient to calculate the color for each pixel
   /// in the destination image according to the value from the corresponding
   /// position in the noise map.
   ///
   /// A color gradient is a list of gradually-changing colors.  A color
   /// gradient is defined by a list of <i>gradient points</i>.  Each
   /// gradient point has a position and a color.  In a color gradient, the
   /// colors between two adjacent gradient points are linearly interpolated.
   ///
   /// For example, suppose this class contains the following color gradient:
   ///
   /// - -1.0 maps to dark blue.
   /// - -0.2 maps to light blue.
   /// - -0.1 maps to tan.
   /// - 0.0 maps to green.
   /// - 1.0 maps to white.
   ///
   /// The value 0.5 maps to a greenish-white color because 0.5 is halfway
   /// between 0.0 (mapped to green) and 1.0 (mapped to white).
   ///
   /// The value -0.6 maps to a medium blue color because -0.6 is halfway
   /// between -1.0 (mapped to dark blue) and -0.2 (mapped to light blue).
   ///
   /// The color gradient requires a minimum of two gradient points.
   ///
   /// This class contains two pre-made gradients: a grayscale gradient and a
   /// color gradient suitable for terrain.  To use these pre-made gradients,
   /// call the buildGrayscaleGradient() or buildTerrainGradient() methods,
   /// respectively.
   ///
   /// @note The color value passed to addGradientPoint() has an alpha
   /// channel.  This alpha channel specifies how a pixel in the background
   /// image (if specified) is blended with the calculated color.  If the
   /// alpha value is high, this class weighs the blend towards the
   /// calculated color, and if the alpha value is low, this class weighs the
   /// blend towards the color from the corresponding pixel in the background
   /// image.
   ///
   /// <b>Specify the light source parameters</b>
   ///
   /// This class contains a parallel light source that lights the image.  It
   /// interprets the noise map as a bump map.
   ///
   /// To enable or disable lighting, pass a Boolean value to the
   /// enableLight() method.
   ///
   /// To set the position of the light source in the "sky", call the
   /// setLightAzimuth() and setLightElev() methods.
   ///
   /// To set the color of the light source, call the setLightColor() method.
   ///
   /// To set the intensity of the light source, call the setLightIntensity()
   /// method.  A good intensity value is 2.0, although that value tends to
   /// "wash out" very light colors from the image.
   /// 
   /// To set the contrast amount between areas in light and areas in shadow,
   /// call the setLightContrast() method.  Determining the correct contrast
   /// amount requires some trial and error, but if your application
   /// interprets the noise map as a height map that has its elevation values
   /// measured in meters and has a horizontal resolution of @a h meters, a
   /// good contrast amount to use is ( 1.0 / @a h ).
   /// 
   /// <b>Specify the background image</b>
   ///
   /// To specify a background image, pass an Image object to the
   /// setBackgroundImage() method.
   ///
   /// This class determines the color of a pixel in the destination image by
   /// blending the calculated color with the color of the corresponding
   /// pixel from the background image.
   ///
   /// The blend amount is determined by the alpha of the calculated color.
   /// If the alpha value is high, this class weighs the blend towards the
   /// calculated color, and if the alpha value is low, this class weighs the
   /// blend towards the color from the corresponding pixel in the background
   /// image.
   ///
   /// <b>Rendering the image</b>

   /// - Pass a NoiseMap object to the setSourceNoiseMap() method.
   /// - Pass an ImageCafe object to the setDestImage() method.
