   /// <b>Gradient example</b>
   ///
   /// Suppose a gradient object contains the following gradient points:
   /// - -1.0 maps to black.
   /// - 0.0 maps to white.
   /// - 1.0 maps to red.
   ///
   /// If an application passes -0.5 to the getColor() method, this method
   /// will return a gray color that is halfway between black and white.

   /// If an application passes 0.25 to the getColor() method, this method
   /// will return a very light pink color that is one quarter of the way
   /// between white and red.
